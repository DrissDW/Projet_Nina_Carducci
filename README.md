As a freelance developer, I've decided to offer my SEO services to new clients. To do so, I analyzed several websites. Among my prospects was the site of Nina Carducci, a photographer.
Nina responded positively to my request and asked me to optimize her website.
This project will therefore consist in satisfying my new client by providing her with a detailed report on my work.

#
My intervention report will present:

* Site performance before and after optimization (based on Lighthouse audits for performance, and Wave audits for accessibility).

* The list of changes I've made to the site.

* A list of the site's use cases, explaining how the site should work, so that Nina can make sure that everything works correctly on her site.
